# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

### 1. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/narenbac/Data-Science-and-ML_Projects/tree/master/House%20Price%20Prediction)
In real estate business one most important thing is to estimate the best price to buy or sale the property. I have the dataset of house prices and the features on which the price depends. So I built a model using machine learning algorithm to estimate the best price of houses and to make profitable business in real estate market.
- Problem type: Regression
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: 88.08 %

### 2. [Loan Prediction](https://github.com/narenbac/Data-Science-and-ML_Projects/tree/master/Loan%20Prediction)
The dataset contains the customer details and bank approves the loan application based on the details. So I did complete Data analysis on the dataset and trained the model to automate the loan approval process easily.
- Problem Type: Classification
- Algorithm:Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: 83.24 % 

### 3. [SUV Car Predictions](https://github.com/narenbac/Data-Science-and-ML_Projects/tree/master/SUV%20Car%20Predictions)
From social network ads, the dataset prepared for user details and whether a user purchased a SUV car or not. Here I used the dataset to analyse and trained a machine learning model to predict SUV Car sales in future based on the user details.
- Problem Type: Classification
- Algorithm: Support Vector Classifier
- Accuracy: 94.87 %

### 4. [Titanic Data](https://github.com/narenbac/Data-Science-and-ML_Projects/tree/master/Titanic%20Data)
The dataset is of Titanic Sinking Disaster and it contains all the passenger's details. There were some people who were lucky to survive. In this project I have explored the data to analyse which factors were made people more lucky to get survived. And I tried machine learning from the disaster for prediction of survivals.
- Problem Type: Classification
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: 78.97 %
